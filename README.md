A couple of items to note.  
The directions seem to not be from the same assignment, which made it very confusing and not really clear. 

For instance, in Step 1, the second action is to "Choose a start date and end date for your trip.  Make sure that your vacation range is approximately 3-15 days total"  But after this step nothing more is really done for the trip analysis.  One of the next steps is to "Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation".
